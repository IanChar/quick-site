# quick-site
## Overview
This shell script will auto-generate a html and css to get started on a web page to the user's specifications. The template is modeled off of the form of webpage that has a static background picture and panes that scroll over the picture (ex. https://ianchar.herokuapp.com/). 
## Usage
Do...
```
./qsite.sh
```
Then enter the specifications for what you want the webpage to look like. Note that you need to have bootstrap for the site to look right.
